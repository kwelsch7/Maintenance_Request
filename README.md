# Maintenance_Request
Submit your complaints here!

Another web app. Here, we have a form to submit a maintenance request that will both:<br>
1) Store in a database, that will be accessible through a UI that the manager logs into<br>
2) Sends an actual email to the manager's address<br>

My hopes and dreams are to do this in Java to practice Java web services, but should be pretty doable in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
